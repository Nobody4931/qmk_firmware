# Custom Ferris Sweep Keymap

## Layer 0: Base Layer

Uses a slightly modified version of the popular [Colemak DH layout](https://colemakmods.github.io/mod-dh/)
with [home row mods](https://precondition.github.io/home-row-mods)

My right pinky has really bad mobility, so the right pinky column of the layout has been replaced with
a single caps lock key to make typing words in all caps easier on a layout without a dedicated shift key

## Layer 1: Number Bracket Layer

Contains number keys on the top row and brackets on the middle row, with helper keys found on the
bottom row, such as `.` and `,` for helping with typing decimals and large numbers

## Layer 2: Symbol Layer

Contains the rest of the symbols not found on layer 1

## Layer 3: Navigation Layer

Contains the arrow keys and other less frequently used navigation keys (eg. the `Home` and `End` keys)
* Arrow keys are placed mimicking Vim's movement keys on a QWERTY keyboard

## Layer 4: Function Layer

Contains the function keys, the escape key, and other miscellaneous system related keys
